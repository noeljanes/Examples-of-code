Quick overview of the purpose of the files:
These files were used to import and analyse data for my Individual Physics Project looking into the feasibility of using a laser to make a sensitive position sensor for the LIGO collaboration.

python files:


Matlab files:
These matlab files were used to process images of the travel of a position "flag" across a laser beam. 
This was done to get a measure of the responsivity of the flags
